Such an archaic, yet simple and sweet concept of providing written words in a well-designed letter seems to be fading away, as celebrations become part of mundane things rather something unique and meaningful.</span></div>
                <div class="line"><span class="content">But worry not, as I intend to make your dreams of seeing a letter addressed to you – come true and finally make your birthday unique :3.</span></div>

                <div class="line"><span class="content">I’ve never really bothered to gift things to people in  my life, as I’ve never had so many people that I actually cared for and have so much bond with. Celebrations and birthdays of anybody I knew were always about attending, wishing the good things to that person and just spend time there. Gifts were optional at least for me, because gifting anything that wasn’t money was just useless. As you know, I’m still young in my life and I can’t really throw money at people anytime I want :p.</span></div>
                <div class="line"><span class="content">Anybody that I cared for deeply were always happy to see me at any time, with or without gifts, doesn’t really matter. It was always about spending a good portion of time with them, recognize our importance in each other’s lives and have fun in the end.</span></div>
                <div class="line"><span class="content">The question of whether or not I should gift something depends on the person. Someone would just enjoy my company without brining any gifts, but somebody just deserved something that had so much effort put into, showing that you actually respect and love the companionship with that said person.</span></div>

                <div class="line"><span class="content">I love you. I wouldn’t utter that word to anybody else, but you. I’d never imagine myself saying it to somebody who used to be a complete stranger for me a few weeks ago, yet alone write paragraphs of texts to that said person as a letter, but here we’re.</span></div>
                <div class="line"><span class="content">You’ve showed me your compassion and care that I yearned for unknowingly all of my life, wandering empty, not knowing what the hell I deserve in this life, tormented by being alone, secluded from any sources of intimate care until I met you.</span></div>
                <div class="line"><span class="content">You’ve showed the ways I should’ve got through years ago, but never did, because I was robbed of such opportunity. My sense for love was deeply deformed in the process, left to rot, but you’ve reshaped it and showed me it in various ways. And I absolutely loved every bit of it.</span></div>
                <div class="line"><span class="content">Thank you. I know I shouldn’t say it, but I can’t otherwise let you know that you’ve helped me. I love you and wish you everything what YOU want and DESIRE for.
